# 1000 Q&A for DRPCIV

This is an online platform built with `React` and `Flask` which displays over 1000 Q&A required to pass the driving exam in Romania. The project was built in 2019 as a personal project designed to help me learn both `Flask` and `React`, and has not been maintained ever since.

## Running the platform
Before running the platform, clone the repo locally: `git clone git@github.com:mihneamanolache/1000-DRPCIV-QA.git`. Afterwards, you will have to start both the Flask server and the Rect server. To so, open two teerminal windows and `cd` to `1000-DRPCIV-QA` and run the following commands, one in each terminal window:

```
npm run start-api # To start the Flask server
npm run start # To start the React server
```

Once both running, the machine should open a new browser window at `http://localhost:3000/`
